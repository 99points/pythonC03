# 3.5 Write a program that prints the following patterns separately, one below the other each pat- tern separated from the next by one blank line. Use for loops to generate the patterns. All asterisks (*) should be printed by a single statement of the form
# print '*',
# (which causes the asterisks to print side by side separated by a space). (Hint: The last two patterns require that each line begin with an appropriate number of blanks.) Extra credit: Combine your code from the four separate problems into a single program that prints all four patterns side by side by making clever use of nested for loops. For all parts of this programâ€”minimize the numbers of asterisks and spaces and the number of statements that print these characters.
